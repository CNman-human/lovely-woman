## 目录

女性是上天最美好的造物

## 前言

此github项目为对[evil-man](https://github.com/CNwoman-bot/evil-man)的讽刺和对所有类似的将政治诉求搬上github的反对，不代表任何社会主张或政治诉求。

近期陆续有许多心系github的程序员自发举报它，我在此表示感谢，并希望同时去举报[evil-man](https://github.com/CNwoman-bot/evil-man)，希望两个rep能同时消失，还github一片净土。

在这一目标达成之前，我并不希望这一repo成为对应的盲目的仇恨内容，所以采用了相反地标题，欢迎共同描述女性的伟大和可爱。

作为一个普通的中国男性程序员，我对所有受到男性不正当侵犯的女性表达最真诚的同情和关心，我在我的生活中也在尽力反对歧视女性。但我不会像很多别的男人的做法一样，为此道歉，因为我并不认为将男人视为一个整体来仇视和谴责是一种合适而理智的做法，如果这种类推可以成立，那么一样可以类推到人类，哺乳动物乃至所有生物，这是非常荒谬的。因此而道歉不过是许下空头支票，毫无意义。

但同时，我谨自不量力地为中国人近年流行的将政治诉求带入github的行为表达歉意，因为在启蒙运动以后，将一个国家的人视为一个整体是一种广泛被接受且有合理性的做法。但也请理解这是一个很大的国家，有全世界六分之一的人口，我们并不都是这样，请帮助制止这样的错误行为，谢谢。

## Foreword

This GitHub repo is a sarcasm to [evil-man](https://github.com/CNwoman-bot/evil-man) and all similar repos that bring politics to Github. It aims to show that we are against to bring political request to GitHub and it does not represent any political or social request.

If you are annoyed by this repo, welcome to report it, only if you report [evil-man](https://github.com/CNwoman-bot/evil-man) at the same time. The only aim for this repo is to end both this and [evil-man](https://github.com/CNwoman-bot/evil-man) repo.

Before this aim is accomplished, I don't wont this repo to be the corresponding hating repository, so I named it right contrary. Welcom everyone to explain how lovely and admirable women are.

As a normal Chinese male programmer, I give my deepest and most sincere concern and sympathy to women hurt by man and I am against any discrimination. However, I will not, as many men will do in such situation, apologize for what have been done by some men. It is ridiculous to take all male human being as a community to be hated and criticize on. If such reason by analogy could be accepted,  we would have same full reason to hate all human, all mammals or even all living things. Thus apologizing for such thing is meaningless.

At the same thing, I humbly apologize, which is beyond myself, for the political repos my compatriot have brought into GitHub recent years. I am doing so, which seems to be contrary to above, is because taking people from a country as a community is a widely accepted and reasonable idea since enlightenment. Once government is still the necessary evil, it will remain a fair judge. However please always keep in mind this is a rather large country consisting of one-sixth of the whole human population. They don't represent us at all and most of us love and precious this community and open source. Please help to stop such rude behaviors and help us report them. Thank you!
